### I didn’t start in UX — but everything I’ve done has led me here.

I arrived at user experience the long way around.  
Not through design school or a tech bootcamp, but through years of listening, translating, simplifying, and helping people make sense of complicated systems.

My path has always been about people.

Before I ever wrote a line of UX copy or mapped a service flow, I served as a Civil Affairs Sergeant in the U.S. Army. That work taught me something foundational: **every environment, no matter how structured or chaotic, is shaped by human needs, motivations, and relationships**. You can’t solve anything if you don’t understand the humans involved.

After the Army, I worked my way through roles in analysis, IT, customer experience, and technical repair. Each one required the same core skills: breaking down complexity, meeting people where they are, and communicating clearly. I didn’t know it at the time, but I was building the muscle memory of a content strategist.

### The turning point: putting people at the center

When I joined the Social Security Administration, everything clicked.

I found myself working on systems that millions of people rely on — retirees, families, individuals with disabilities — each bringing their own needs, anxieties, and hopes. The stakes were real. The work mattered. And suddenly, the thread running through my entire career became clear:

**I’ve always been drawn to the kind of work where clarity helps people move forward, and where thoughtful design can quietly remove friction from someone’s day.**

At SSA, I helped modernize critical public-facing experiences, build content strategies rooted in empathy and plain language, support human-centered design efforts, and collaborate with teams across policy, engineering, research, and operations. It was the most “UX” environment I’d ever been in — and it felt exactly right.

### What I love about this work

UX and content strategy sit at the intersection of:

- **story and structure**  
- **human need and system constraint**  
- **clarity and complexity**  
- **the problem and the possibility**

And that’s where I thrive.

My approach is shaped by everything that came before it: military service, technical repair, federal service, leadership, analysis, and a lot of listening. I value design that is **responsible**, **empathetic**, and **human-first** — not just beautiful or clever.

### Today

I’m focused on work that makes essential information clearer, services easier to use, and digital spaces feel a little more humane. I love helping teams slow down, ask better questions, and build with intention.

If that’s the kind of work you’re doing — or want to be doing — I’d love to connect.
