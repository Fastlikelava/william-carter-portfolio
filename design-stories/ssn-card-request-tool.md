# SSN Card Request Tool  
### Workflow Design • Eligibility Logic • UX Writing • Mobile-First UI • End-to-End HCD

## Design Story Overview

Requesting or replacing a Social Security card sounds simple — but in practice, it’s one of SSA’s **most complex eligibility workflows**.

Users fall into dozens of categories:

- Newly married / name change  
- U.S. citizens or non-citizens  
- Newborns applying for their first SSN  
- People living abroad  
- People experiencing homelessness  
- Users without access to original documents  

Before this work, SSA’s guidance was difficult to navigate:

- **Scattered across many pages**  
- Written in **technical program language**  
- Lacked a clear starting point  
- Hard to use on mobile  
- Confusing for users with limited documentation knowledge  

The SSN Card Request Tool was designed to **simplify the eligibility journey**, reduce confusion, and guide users step-by-step to the correct instructions for *their* situation.

I served as a **UX strategist, content designer, and flow architect**, shaping the logic, UI structure, and plain-language experience behind the tool.

# 1. Problem & Context

The original experience had several challenges:

### 1. Highly complex policy
Eligibility rules vary depending on:

- citizenship  
- age  
- name-change status  
- immigration category  
- presence of original or certified documents  
- location (inside the U.S. vs abroad)  

### 2. Scattered information
Instructions were spread across:

- multiple help pages  
- outdated FAQs  
- policy manuals (POMS)  
- office-specific exceptions  

### 3. High operational burden

Users frequently arrived at field offices:

- without the right documents  
- unsure which form they needed  
- confused about eligibility  
- misdirected for tasks they *could* do online  

### 4. High-stress, high-stakes task

Users urgently needed clarity for:

- employment  
- school enrollment  
- housing applications  
- benefit enrollment  

We needed an experience that was:

- clear  
- mobile-first  
- personalized  
- low-literacy-friendly  
- policy-accurate  
- accessible

# 2. My Role & Team

### **Role: UX Strategist / Content Designer**

I led or co-led:

- Mapping the **full decision logic**  
- Translating policy → **user-friendly questions**  
- Designing wireframes and multi-step flows  
- Creating mobile-first UI patterns  
- Writing eligibility and result content  
- Ensuring design system + accessibility alignment  
- Collaborating closely with policy SMEs and operations teams  

### Core collaborators:

- Policy experts (SSN/Enumeration)  
- UX researchers  
- Front-end developers  
- Spanish-language reviewers  
- Field office SMEs  
- Accessibility and design system contributors

# 3. End-to-End Design Process

## 3.1 Discovery & Research

We identified:

- the *top reasons* people request an SSN card  
- the *biggest user misunderstandings*  
- the *most common failure points* in eligibility flows  

### Research methods:

- Analytics review (search queries, task funnels)  
- Interviews with field office staff  
- Review of call-center logs  
- Assessment of common user error cases  
- Spanish-language comprehension feedback  
- Comparative analysis of decision tools (DMV, USCIS, GOV.UK)  

### Key insights:

- Users misunderstood what “original documents” meant  
- Name-change workflows were deeply confusing  
- Non-citizen pathways were unclear  
- Living-abroad rules were hidden or inconsistent  
- Users felt overwhelmed by dense information  

*Suggested visual:* A simplified behavior flow or funnel chart representing user confusion pathways.

## 3.2 Defining Logic & Requirements

The tool required mapping **every possible user scenario**, including:

- reason for request  
- citizenship status  
- location  
- documentation availability  
- special exceptions  

We converted complex program logic into **user-centered logic**:

1. Who are you?  
2. Why do you need a card?  
3. Where are you located?  
4. Do you have these documents?  
5. What applies to your situation?  

This produced a streamlined decision-tree architecture.

*Suggested visual:* A generic decision-tree diagram showing branching pathways.

## 3.3 Design & Prototyping (Figma)

### Deliverables I created:

- Wireframes for each decision step  
- Mobile-first UI patterns  
- Question and answer structures  
- Document explainer components  
- Results-page layout and content  
- Reusable components integrated with the design system  

### UX principles used:

- **One question per screen**  
- **Plain language**  
- **Contextual help** for documents  
- **Progressive disclosure**  
- **Error prevention through clarity**  
- **WCAG AA+ accessibility**  

*Suggested visual:* A mobile-screen wireframe of a question step.

## 3.4 Testing & Iteration

We used:

- Moderated usability sessions  
- Comprehension testing  
- Spanish-language QA  
- Accessibility reviews  
- Policy accuracy checks  
- Error-case walkthroughs  

### Improvements made:

- Simplified question wording  
- Reordered steps based on user mental models  
- Added clearer document descriptions  
- Strengthened final “Next Steps” instructions  
- Improved readability and scannability  
- Ensured parity across English and Spanish  

Testing confirmed major increases in clarity and task confidence.

## 3.5 Delivery & Collaboration

I collaborated with:

- Developers (to convert logic → code)  
- Spanish reviewers (for linguistic parity)  
- Policy teams (for accuracy)  
- Operations teams (to confirm office readiness)  

We aligned on:

- Valid eligibility pathing  
- Content logic  
- Error-handling rules  
- UI patterns  
- Launch timing and review cycles

# 4. Outcomes & Impact

### Clarity & comprehension

- Significant reduction in comprehension errors  
- Spanish-language comprehension improved due to rewritten structures  
- Name-change confusion dropped from **~60% → ~15%** in testing  

### Operational impact

- Fewer misdirected field office visits  
- Better-prepared users (correct documents on first attempt)  
- Reduced documentation confusion  
- Decreased “What do I need to bring?” call volume  

### User empowerment

Users reported:

- “finally knowing what I actually need”  
- “feeling less stressed”  
- “understanding what applies to me”

# 5. Relevance to Institutional Services

This project strengthened my ability to design:

- **multi-step, rules-based workflows**  
- **eligibility logic tools**  
- **guided decision experiences**  
- **back-office-optimized processes**  
- **compliance-aligned UI patterns**  

### Direct relevance to M&T’s Institutional Services:

- Appian-style rule-driven workflows  
- Internal operational process mapping  
- High-clarity experiences for complex tasks  
- Cross-functional design alignment  
- System logic translated into user flows  

This project is a perfect example of designing experiences that work for users *and* meet strict regulatory and operational requirements.

# 6. Final Summary

The SSN Card Request Tool demonstrates how user-centered design can:

- simplify a highly complex task  
- reduce operational burden  
- improve accuracy  
- support multilingual access  
- increase clarity and user confidence  

Across research, design, logic mapping, testing, and delivery, I helped create an eligibility experience that is clearer, more accessible, and more efficient.

This is the type of workflow-heavy, mission-critical design work I’m passionate about.
