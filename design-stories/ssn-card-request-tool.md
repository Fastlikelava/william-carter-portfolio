### Workflow Design • Complex Eligibility Logic • Content + UI

> Full Design Story coming soon.

This tool helps people understand **how to get or replace a Social Security card** based on their specific situation:

- Newly married or name change  
- Living abroad  
- Non-U.S. citizens entitled to SSN cards  
- Unhoused individuals  
- Other special cases  

The work involved:

- Mapping complex policy rules into clear, answerable questions  
- Designing branching flows that lead to tailored instructions  
- Collaborating with developers to ensure the logic matched system constraints  
- Measuring impact through increased self-service and reductions in in-office and phone requests
