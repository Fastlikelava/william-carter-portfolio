# SSA.gov Digital-First Redesign

---

## Design Story Overview

When the pandemic reshaped how Americans accessed government services, SSA faced a historic challenge:  
a legacy website with **78,000+ pages**, low satisfaction, and inconsistent user experience across channels.

As a **Content Strategist & UX Lead**, I helped drive SSA’s largest digital transformation effort in more than a decade — the **digital-first redesign of SSA.gov**, impacting more than **180 million annual visitors**.

My work centered on:

- **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** at enterprise scale  
- Building a **Figma design system** aligned with USWDS  
- Redesigning high-impact workflows (Retirement, Medicare, SSN, SSI)  
- Simplifying complexity using **plain language**  
- Iterative design & validation using **research + analytics**  
- Cross-functional leadership across USDS, GSA, CMS, developers, and policy teams  

**Outcome:**  
**+22.3 CSAT improvement**, **25% increase in online transactions**, and **550% growth** in online benefit verification letters — directly reducing office traffic and call-center load.

# 1. Problem & Context

SSA.gov was one of the most visited government websites, but:

- Content was scattered across **tens of thousands** of legacy pages  
- Findability was low and task pathways were unclear  
- Mobile layouts were dense and inconsistent  
- Spanish content needed modernization & accessibility upgrades  
- No unified design system or editorial standard existed  
- Pandemic-driven demand exposed major gaps in digital service delivery  

**Baseline pain signals:**  

- CSAT stuck at **47.7**  
- High abandonment on common task flows  
- Increased call-center volume  
- Users struggled with long, text-heavy pages  

SSA partnered with USDS to launch a full, digital-first redesign — and I was a core contributor to strategy, content, workflows, and iterative testing.

# 2. My Role & Team

### Role: Content Strategist / UX Lead

I partnered with designers, developers, researchers, and product owners to design, test, and launch new digital experiences.

**My contributions included:**

- Leading content strategy & plain-language adoption  
- Designing flows & prototypes for top tasks  
- Building and governing the **Figma-based SSA design system**  
- Analyzing Medallia & GA data to identify improvements  
- Supporting usability testing in English and Spanish  
- Collaborating with USDS, GSA, CMS, and internal SSA components  
- Co-founding the **Digital Experience Council** for cross-agency alignment  
- Delivering iterative releases in an Agile environment

# 3. End-to-End Design Process

## 3.1 Discovery & Research

### Quantitative research

- Medallia verbatims & satisfaction scoring  
- Google Analytics & Digital Analytics Program (DAP) flow analysis  
- Task abandonment & drop-off analysis  
- Search query analysis (internal & external)

*Figure: Examples of quantitative data analysis used during discovery — CSAT trends, task funnel drop-off, and search term frequency (illustrative only; no SSA data).*

### Qualitative research

- Customer interviews  
- Spanish-language usability studies  
- Accessibility walkthroughs  
- Field insights from front-line SSA employees  

### Key insights

- Dense, complex content blocked comprehension  
- Top tasks were buried under the fold  
- Mobile users struggled with layout patterns  
- Spanish content (when avalible) lacked consistency & accessibility  
- Progressive disclosure dramatically improved comprehension  

---

## 3.2 Definition & Alignment

I helped define the redesign strategy using:

- **Top task prioritization**: top 20 pages = ~90% of traffic  
- **Success metrics**: CSAT, task completion time, adoption  
- **Cross-component alignment** via the Digital Experience Council  
- Editorial + IA standards co-developed across stakeholders

## 3.3 Design & Prototyping (Figma)

### I created:

- Wireframes  
- Task flows  
- High-fidelity templates  
- Content patterns  
- Eligibility decision trees  
- Figma design system components  
- Content databases  

### Design principles:

- 4th-grade reading level  
- One decision per screen  
- Mobile-first layouts  
- Clear, unambiguous CTAs  
- USWDS alignment  
- WCAG AA+ accessibility  
- Progressive disclosure

## 3.4 Testing & Iteration

I collaborated with UX researchers to conduct:

- Moderated usability tests  
- Content comprehension tests  
- Spanish-language reviews  
- Accessibility checks  
- A/B comparisons  

### Measurable improvements

- Paragraph length reduced by 40–60%  
- Improved comprehension across all redesigned pages  
- Higher click-through to “Start Application” actions  
- Stronger trust signals in plain-language content  
- Better scannability via headings & spacing

## 3.5 Agile Delivery & Collaboration

Throughout the redesign I participated in:

- Sprint planning  
- Backlog grooming  
- Daily standups  
- QA/content freeze cycles  
- Feature demos & review sessions  

This ensured:

- Design intent was preserved through development  
- Complex content stayed accurate  
- Spanish versions aligned with English UX patterns  
- Releases remained iterative and user-driven

# 4. Outcomes & Impact

### Customer Satisfaction

- **47.7 → 70.0 CSAT** after redesign

# 5. What I Learned & Relevance to Institutional Services

Designing SSA.gov taught me to navigate:

- Complex workflows  
- Rigid regulatory environments  
- Multi-stakeholder dependencies  
- Accessibility at scale  
- Data-driven iteration  
- Enterprise-level governance  

### Direct relevance to Institutional Services

- **Workflow design:** Eligibility, claims, and verification flows mirror back-office institutional workflows.  
- **Design systems:** I maintained a multi-team design system in Figma — directly aligned with Appian UI consistency needs.  
- **Stakeholder alignment:** I coordinated policy, dev, research, and service teams — similar to cross-functional product squads.  
- **Measurable impact:** My work resulted in significant improvements across CSAT, adoption, and efficiency.  
- **Agile collaboration:** I delivered design increments in sprints alongside analysts, PMs, and developers.  

---

# 6. Final Summary

This redesign transformed SSA.gov into a clearer, more accessible, and more human digital service for millions of people.

My contributions reflect:

- End-to-end UX leadership  
- Visual/UI design and Figma proficiency  
- Complex workflow mapping  
- Design system governance  
- User research + iterative refinement  
- Enterprise collaboration  
- Proven, measurable results  

This body of work directly supports my readiness to design Appian workflows, institutional-service tools, and enterprise experiences.
