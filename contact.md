### Let’s start a thoughtful conversation.

Whether you're exploring potential collaboration, looking for a UX/Content Strategist, or simply curious about my work, I’d love to connect. I approach every interaction the same way I approach design: with clarity, empathy, and a focus on the humans on the other side.

For professional inquiries, the best way to reach me is on LinkedIn:

If you're interested in my résumé, case studies, or deeper context on my work, feel free to message me there. I tailor what I share based on the conversation—because meaningful work starts with understanding what *you* need.

**Looking forward to connecting.**
