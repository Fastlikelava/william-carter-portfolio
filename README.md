# William Carter — Portfolio (Jekyll on GitHub Pages)

A lightweight, professional portfolio for a UX & Content Strategy leader. Built with **Jekyll** and the **minima** theme (both supported on GitHub Pages).

## Quick Start

1. Create a new repo on GitHub (public is fine for Pages).
2. Upload this folder's contents to the repo.
3. In repo **Settings → Pages**, choose:
   - **Branch**: `main` (or `master`)
   - **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Wait a minute or two. Your site will publish at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/` (or at your custom domain once configured).
5. Edit `_config.yml` with your **url**, **LinkedIn**, etc.

Want a custom domain?
- Add your domain under **Settings → Pages**.
- Create a `CNAME` file at the root (GitHub can auto-generate it).
- Point your DNS to GitHub Pages.

See `docs/UPDATE_GUIDE.md` for how to edit content.
